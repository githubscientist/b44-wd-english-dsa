/*
    LIFO: Last In First Out

    Last element inserted in the stack gets deleted first

    or 

    FILO: First In Last Out

    First element inserted in the stack gets deleted last

    Stack Operations:

    1. push: inserting an element into the stack
    2. pop: deleting an element from the stack
    3. tos: returns the topmost element in the stack
    4. isEmpty: return true if the stack is empty and false otherwise
    5. isFull: return true if the stack is full and false otherwise

    Stack Implementation:

    1. Array Implementation of a Stack
    2. Object Implementation of a Stack

    Stack Overflow: 
        Occurs when we try to do a push operation on the stack
        that is already full
    
    Stack Underflow:
        Occurs when we try to do a pop operation on the stack
        that is already empty
